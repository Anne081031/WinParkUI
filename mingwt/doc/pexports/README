PEXPORTS 0.43 README
============================================

PEXPORTS is a program to extract exported symbols from a PE image
(executable). It can perform a simple check on the size of the
arguments of the exported functions, provided there is a header with
prototypes for the functions. This is useful when you want the
decorated function names for functions using the stdcall calling
convention. GCC is used to do the preprocessing so it must be in your
path.

Note that the mingw32 version uses ';' as path separator,
while the cygwin version uses ':'.

Command line options:
=====================
        -h <header> parse header
        -o print function ordinals
        -p <preprocessor> set preprocessor
        -v verbose mode

Header files are searched for in the following directories:
1. Current directory
2. Directories in C_INCLUDE_PATH
3. Directories in CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
4. Directories in PATH

NOTE: The header parser is *very* primitive, it only tries to find
function prototypes and check the number of arguments a function
expects. It is NOT a complete C parser, there are probably many
conditions when it will fail (especially complex parameter types),
although I it works fine for me.  Please report bugs or send me a
patch.

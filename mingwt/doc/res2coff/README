Second, should you reuse it, I'd really appretiate a reference to this 
software. Blessings (if the program is useful to you), why not. Blamings,
none.

Now how to use it:

res2coff [-v] -i <resource file> -o <object file>

Both the resource and the object file have to be fully qualified and include
the extension. I never assume anything about files.

the -v flag will turn on a verbose mode which will show you a
short recap of all resources found in the resource file.

Revision history:

v1.00 First 'working' version using Jacob Navia's lccwin32
v1.10 Ported to the Minimalist GNUWIN32 with the win32 headers
      from lccwin32, modified to pack system structures under GCC
v1.20 Sorts the string tables found and now passes the tests
      in RCL 1.6.3

Enjoy
